      <p>There are many ways to tell a story. For instance, through a sound track. stedr lets you share sound tracks about a place with other users. It might also be a way to share a story told by a person or a sound in the environment.</p>
      <p>The sounds shared in stedr are retrieved from SoundCloud. To share your sound track in stedr, you need a user account on SoundCloud. Then follow these steps:</p>

      <ul class="bullet">
        <li>Add the keywords that stedr lets you copy to the phone clipboard</li>
        <li>If you are using Android: Open the SoundCloud application on your mobile phone<br>If you are using iPhone: SoundCloud recommends you to use the AudioCopy application</li>
        <li>Record, clip and save a sound</li>
        <li>Save the sound</li>
        <li>Use the keywords from the clipboard in the title of your track. You can compose any title you wish, but it should contain the keywords to be retrieved in stedr</li>
      </ul>

      <p>Note that it is possible to change any information associated to a sound track through the web interface to SoundCloud on a PC afterwards. We recommend you to add a description to the track: What is the track about? When was it recorded? This cannot yet be done from the mobile application.</p>
